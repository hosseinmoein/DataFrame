## [*DataFrame Documentation / Code Samples*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hosseinmoein/DataFrame/blob/master/docs/HTML/DataFrame.html)
This is a C++ analytical library that provides interface and functionality similar to packages/libraries in Python and R. For example, you could compare this to Pandas or R data.frame.<BR>
You could slice the data in many different ways. You could join, merge, group-by the data. You could run various statistical, summarization, financial, and ML algorithms on the data. You could add your custom algorithms easily. You could multi-column sort, custom pick and delete the data. And more …<BR>
DataFrame also includes a large collection of analytical algorithms in form of visitors. These are from basic stats such as <I>Mean</I>, <I>Std Deviation</I>, <I>Return</I>, … to more involved analysis such as <I>Affinity Propagation</I>, <I>Polynomial Fit</I>, <I>Fast Fourier transform of arbitrary length</I> … including a good collection of trading indicators. You could also easily add your own algorithms.<BR>
For basic operations to start you off, see [Hello World](examples/hello_world.cc). For a complete list of features with code samples, see [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hosseinmoein/DataFrame/blob/master/docs/HTML/DataFrame.html).

I have followed a few <B>principles in this library</B>:<BR>

1.  Support any type either built-in or user defined without needing new code
2.  Never chase pointers ala `linked lists`, `std::any`, `pointer to base`, ..., including `virtual functions`
3.  Have all column data in contiguous memory space. Also, be mindful of cache-line aliasing misses between multiple columns
4.  Never use more space than you need ala `unions`, `std::variant`, ...
5.  Avoid copying data as much as possible
6.  Use multi-threading but only when it makes sense
7.  Do not attempt to protect the user against `garbage in`, `garbage out`

[DateTime](docs/DateTimeDoc.pdf)<BR>
DateTime class included in this library is a very cool and handy object to manipulate date/time with nanosecond precision and multi timezone capability.<BR>

### Performance
There is a test program [_dataframe_performance_](benchmarks/dataframe_performance.cc) that should give you a sense of how this library performs. As a comparison, there is also a Pandas [_pandas_performance_](benchmarks/pandas_performance.py) script that does exactly the same thing.<BR>
<I>dataframe_performance.cc</I> uses DataFrame <B>async interface</B> and is compiled with gcc (10.3.0) compiler with -O3 flag. <I>pandas_performance.py</I> is ran with Pandas 1.3.2, Numpy 1.21.2 and Python 3.7 on Xeon E5-2667 v2. What the test program roughly does:<BR>

1.  Generate ~1.6 billion timestamps (second resolution) and load them into the DataFrame/Pandas as index.<BR>
2.  Generate ~1.6 billion random numbers for 3 columns with normal, log normal, and exponential distributions and load them into the DataFrame/Pandas.<BR>
3.  Calculate the mean of each of the 3 columns.<BR>

Result:
```bash
$ python3 benckmarks/pandas_performance.py
Starting ... 1629817655
All memory allocations are done. Calculating means ... 1629817883
6.166675403767268e-05, 1.6487168460770107, 0.9999539627671375

All memory allocations are done. Calculating means ... 1629818535

real    3m34.241s                                                                                                                      
user    3m14.250s
sys     0m25.983s
```
<B>The Interesting Part:</B><BR>
1.  Pandas script, I believe, is entirely implemented in Numpy which is in C.
2.  In case of Pandas, allocating memory + random number generation takes almost the same amount of time as calculating means.
3.  In case of DataFrame ~90% of the time is spent in allocating memory + random number generation.
4.  You load data once, but calculate statistics many times. So DataFrame, in general, is about ~11x faster than parts of Pandas that are implemented in Numpy. I leave parts of Pandas that are purely in Python to imagination.
5.  Pandas process image at its peak is ~105GB. C++ DataFrame process image at its peak is ~56GB.

### Installing using CMake
```bash
mkdir [Debug | Release]
cd [Debug | Release]
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Release] ..
make
make install

cd [Debug | Release]
make uninstall
```

### Package managers
DataFrame is available on _Conan_ platform. Add `dataframe/x.y.z@` to your requires, where `x.y.z` is the release version you want to use. _Conan_ will acquire DataFrame, build it from source in your computer, and provide CMake integration support for your projects. See the [_Conan_ docs](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/) for more information.<BR> Sample `conanfile.txt`:

```text
[requires]
dataframe/1.20.0@

[generators]
cmake
```
DataFrame is also available on [_Microsoft VCPKG_](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) platform
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
bootstrap-vcpkg.[bat|sh]
vcpkg(.exe) integrate install
vcpkg(.exe) install DataFrame
```
