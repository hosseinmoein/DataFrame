        <I>Matrix</I> is an efficient and flat-memory implementation of matrix. It implements many numerical analysis and algorithms. It is used internally by <I>DataFrame</I> library to implement few of its algorithms. Also, some of <I>DataFrame</I> analysis results are in <I>Matrix</I> format.<BR>
        A structurally symmetric matrix (IS_SYM is true) requires almost half the memory size of a normal matrix.
