# AddInstallRPATHSupport
# ----------------------
#
# Add support to RPATH during installation to your project::
#
#   add_install_rpath_support([BIN_DIRS dir [dir]]
#                             [LIB_DIRS dir [dir]]
#                             [INSTALL_NAME_DIR [dir]]
#                             [DEPENDS condition [condition]]
#                             [USE_LINK_PATH])
#
# Normally (depending on the platform) when you install a shared
# library you can either specify its absolute path as the install name,
# or leave just the library name itself. In the former case the library
# will be correctly linked during run time by all executables and other
# shared libraries, but it must not change its install location. This
# is often the case for libraries installed in the system default
# library directory (e.g. ``/usr/lib``).
# In the latter case, instead, the library can be moved anywhere in the
# file system but at run time the dynamic linker must be able to find
# it. This is often accomplished by setting environmental variables
# (i.e. ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` on Linux).
# This procedure is usually not desirable for two main reasons:
#
# - by setting the variable you are changing the default behaviour
#   of the dynamic linker thus potentially breaking executables (not as
#   destructive as ``LD_PRELOAD``)
# - the variable will be used only by applications spawned by the shell
#   and not by other processes.
#
# RPATH is aimed to solve the issues introduced by the second
# installation method. Using run-path dependent libraries you can
# create a directory structure containing executables and dependent
# libraries that users can relocate without breaking it.
# A run-path dependent library is a dependent library whose complete
# install name is not known when the library is created.
# Instead, the library specifies that the dynamic loader must resolve
# the libraryâ€™s install name when it loads the executable that depends
# on the library. The executable or the other shared library will
# hardcode in the binary itself the additional search directories
# to be passed to the dynamic linker. This works great in conjunction
# with relative paths.
# This command will enable support to RPATH to your project.
# It will enable the following things:
#
#  - If the project builds shared libraries it will generate a run-path
#    enabled shared library, i.e. its install name will be resolved
#    only at run time.
#  - In all cases (building executables and/or shared libraries)
#    dependent shared libraries with RPATH support will be properly
#
# The command has the following parameters:
#
# Options:
#  - ``USE_LINK_PATH``: if passed the command will automatically adds to
#    the RPATH the path to all the dependent libraries.
#
# Arguments:
#  - ``BIN_DIRS`` list of directories when the targets (executable and
#    plugins) will be installed.
#  - ``LIB_DIRS`` list of directories to be added to the RPATH. These
#    directories will be added "relative" w.r.t. the ``BIN_DIRS`` and
#    ``LIB_DIRS``.
#  - ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` directory where the libraries will be installed.
#    This variable will be used only if ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH`` or
#    ``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH`` is set to ``TRUE`` as it will set the
#    ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` on all targets
#  - ``DEPENDS`` list of conditions that should be ``TRUE`` to enable
#    RPATH, for example ``FOO; NOT BAR``.
#
# Note: see https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16589 for further
# details.
