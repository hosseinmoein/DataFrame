# Thank you for choosing to contribute to DataFrame

### Did you find a bug
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one and mark it as **bug**. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* If you wrote a patch that fixes a bug
  * Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
  * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
  * Follow the same coding conventions and formatting already in DataFrame, as much as you can

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
* Open an issue and mark it as **new feature** and clearly describe the new feature/enhancement.
* Wait a few days for feedback.
* Open a branch and implement your new addition/enhancement.
* Follow the same coding conventions and formatting already in DataFrame, as much as you can
* write an **explicit and comprehensive** test for your new addition/enhancement.
* Make sure your new addition/enhancement and the test compile and run correctly on all supported platforms
* issue a pull request

In general, you should get familiarized with the project and its source code first. I suggest:

1. Read the documentation from beginning to end
2. Get comfortable with compiling the project
3. Go through the Hello World
4. Understand the Vectors code
5. Go through the other test programs along with most of the features in the documentation
6. Contribute + document + write test case
